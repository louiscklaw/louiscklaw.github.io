### Purpose:

This page hold some appium source code from me.

### Practice:

Usually I test apps with android in the following way:

1. general app / WPA (HKO weather)

- test with android emulator (e.g. appium-android-12-tryout)

2. with specific hardware (handy)

- setup test stand

But most of the time i keep the host part inside docker, just like the block diagram above.

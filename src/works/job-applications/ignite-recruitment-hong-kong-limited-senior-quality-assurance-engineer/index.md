### Cover letter

<div class="letter-container">
Dear Hiring Manager,

<div class="spacer"></div>

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Quality Assurance Engineer position at your opening. With over 10 years of experience in the telecom and software industry, I am confident that my skills and background align well with the requirements of the role.

Throughout my career, I have gained extensive experience in quality assurance engineering, working with JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, and automation testing tools such as Robot Framework and Selenium WebDriver. I have also successfully identified performance issues using Apache JMeter and have a strong understanding of databases like Postgres, Oracle, and MariaDB.

In addition to my technical expertise, I have a thorough understanding of quality assurance concepts and tools such as Docker, CI/CD, and Jenkins. I have led and guided other quality assurance engineers through challenging situations in both project complexity and technical complexity. Furthermore, I have worked successfully in Agile teams following methodologies like Scrum, XP, Lean, or Kanban.

Outside of work, I actively engage in research and development projects. My skills span across various technologies including JavaScript, Python, Docker, software testing, React, GatsbyJS, PHP, C++, and Appium. Additionally, I enjoy hardware/electronic projects using Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

I believe that my passion for learning new technologies combined with my experience in quality assurance make me an ideal candidate for this role.

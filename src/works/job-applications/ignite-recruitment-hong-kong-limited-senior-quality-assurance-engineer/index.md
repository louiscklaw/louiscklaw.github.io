### Cover letter

<div class="letter-container">
Dear Hiring Manager,

<div class="spacer"></div>

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Quality Assurance Engineer position at your opening. With over 10 years of experience in the telecom and software industry, I believe I possess the skills and mindset necessary to contribute effectively to your team.

Throughout my career, I have gained extensive experience in both manual and automation testing, working with JavaScript/TypeScript and Java. I have a strong Quality Assurance mindset and have successfully identified performance issues using tools such as Apache JMeter. Additionally, I am proficient in writing complex queries on databases like mySQL or MariaDB.

In my previous roles at China Mobile Hong Kong, Sierra Wireless, and Tinklabs, I have demonstrated my ability to collaborate with cross-functional teams to deliver innovative solutions that exceed expectations. I have also coached and guided other Quality Assurance Engineers in developing their technical capabilities.

As an active learner and someone who loves research and development, I constantly strive to stay up-to-date with technology trends. My experience with Docker, CI/CD, Jenkins, and Agile methodologies makes me well-equipped for this role.

I invite you to visit my GitHub page (https://louiscklaw.github.io) to explore some of the projects I have worked on. It would be a pleasure to discuss how my skills align with your requirements further.

Thank you for considering my application.

Louis C.K. Law

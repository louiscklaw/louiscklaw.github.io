### Cover letter

<div class="letter-container">
Dear Hiring Manager,

<div class="spacer"></div>

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior QA Engineer position at your opening. With over 10 years of experience in the telecom and software industry, I have developed a strong foundation in automation testing and software development.

During my tenure at China Mobile Hong Kong, Sierra Wireless, and Tinklabs, I gained extensive hands-on experience in automation testing using tools like Appium and Selenium. I have successfully set up automation frameworks from scratch, developed test scripts, and integrated test automation into CI/CD pipelines. My expertise also includes mobile app testing using Java with Appium for both iOS and Android platforms.

I am confident in my ability to contribute to your team's success by developing and delivering high-quality automation test coverage. I am an active learner who is always willing to expand my knowledge and stay updated with the latest best practices in QA methodologies. My experience working in Agile SCRUM teams has honed my ability to handle multiple tasks and projects simultaneously while maintaining a high level of quality.

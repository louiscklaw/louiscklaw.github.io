Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the software test engineer position at your opening. With over 10 years of experience in the telecom and software industry, I am confident that my skills and background make me a strong candidate for this role.

Throughout my career, I have gained valuable experience in various roles, including working at China Mobile Hong Kong, Sierra Wireless, and Tinklabs. My expertise lies in software testing, and I am proficient in JavaScript, Python, Docker, and other relevant technologies. I have a keen eye for detail and possess strong analytical skills.

In addition to my technical skills, I am an active learner who enjoys research and development. In my free time, I work on personal projects involving software development (React, GatsbyJS), hardware (Arduino, Raspberry Pi), PCB layout design, web scraping, and GitHub exploration.

As a daily Linux user with knowledge of web frontend frameworks (React, Next.js, Gatsby) and databases (MySQL/MariaDB, Firebase), I believe that my technical background aligns well with the requirements of the software test engineer position. I am also familiar with GPT techniques and constantly seek opportunities to adopt new technologies.
